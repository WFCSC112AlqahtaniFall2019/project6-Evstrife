In this project, we use two different soring method to sort vector and linked list. According to the execution time picture, we can
find that the execution time for binary insertion sort is growing exponentially, while the execution time for insertion sort in linked
list is growing much slower(The run time for insertion sort as we test is always shorter than 0.1 sec).So we come to an conclusion that
 when the input length is huge, binary insertion search is less efficient than the linked list insertion sort.
